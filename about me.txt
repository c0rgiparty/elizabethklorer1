*** ABOUT ME ***

My name is Elizabeth and I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. I'm a current student @ SAIC, mainly studying fashion, fibers, video, and writing. I tend to work with found objects & second-hand materials in order to place care and intention back into surfaces. Other than that, I like to build from the ground up.
